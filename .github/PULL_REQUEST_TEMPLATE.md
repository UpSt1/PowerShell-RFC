<!--

All new RFCs must:

* have examples of the proposed behavior, preferably in the form of a script (or scripts) which shows the proposed behavior with comments and annotations

All new RFCs should:

* Not have a number - maintainers will assign the number
* Be placed in the Draft folder

Maintainers will sometimes need to make small edits (for example, set the RFC number).
To make this easier, we suggest giving maintainers permission to push to your fork,
see https://github.com/blog/2247-improving-collaboration-with-forks.

Also be sure to read https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/master/RFC0000-RFC-Process.md
